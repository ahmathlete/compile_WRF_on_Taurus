Shell script for compiling the Weather Research and Forecasting Model on HPC Taurus.

## chosen configuration
34 (dmpar) GNU (gfortran/gcc)\
nesting: 1=basic\
3 Linux x86_64, gfortran (dmpar)

## poem
It took several days\
trying a variety of ways\
in the HPC's software maze.

Modules wanted to be loaded\
some extra lines to be coded\
until errors no longer revolted.

With the final shell script\
hopefully you will be well equipped\
to prevent a module compatibility conflict.

The first model run is just ahead\
the WPS waits to be fed\
let's start the first thread...

Thanks to HPC-Support & Fabian
